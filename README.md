# Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard app utilizes openweathermapAPI in order to pull weather data from around the world and transform that information in an easily digestable way. It is a responsive app that can be used on screens of all sizes and aspect ratios, where the user will be able to look up different locations with a working search history and a five day forecast of the wanted location.
